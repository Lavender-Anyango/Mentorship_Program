        <p class="book-summary">
            Funny is how I would describe this amazing book. Reading Born A Crime by  <br>Trevor had me laughing at serious things I never thought Iâ€™d laugh about.
            <br>
            <br>

In the first chapter, Trevor talks about the complexities of race, identity, and the  <br>struggle for survival in a segregated society. Trevor's narrative, born during the  <br>era of apartheid in South Africa, resonates with the Kenyan context, where the  <br>fight for equality and the struggle against colonial and post-colonial eras has  <br>shaped the nation's history and identity.
<br>
<br>

The second chapter delves deeper into the impact of apartheid on Noah's life, <br> focusing on the resilience of women in the absence of their men, who were  <br>either working in prison, in exile, or simply absent due to systemic <br>discrimination. He highlights how Patricia works to get whatever she wants <br>despite the rules put in place. I relate this to the Kenyan struggle for <br>independence and the fight against colonialism, women are also bold to stand <br>up for themselves now.

<br>
<br>

He highlights the power of humor as a coping mechanism and a means to <br> navigate the harsh realities of segregation. His stories, filled with humor and <br> honesty, provide a moving and funny portrait of a boy making his way through a <br>damaged world in a dangerous time. This narrative is not only a personal story <br> of survival but also a broader commentary on the legacy of colonialism and the <br>fight for equality in post-colonial societies, themes that are deeply intertwined  <br>with Kenya's history.
